# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was made as an introduction to web development.
I was to make a webpage that would be used to store our notes on the prework prior to the Web Dev Bootcamp.
I learned about HTML which contains the content of the webpage, CSS which styles the page, and JavaScript which provides functionality and interactivity on the webpage.

## Usage

This webpage is used to store and look back on the notes I made while going through the prework for the Web Dev Bootcamp.
The notes are seperated into 4 sections; HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
The use of JavaScript functions can be seen in the DevTools console of the browser. 
It lists the topics we learned in one function and then chooses one for us to study first in another.
